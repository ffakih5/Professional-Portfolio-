## Motivation
Having completed a third of Coding Bootcamp it's time to celebrate the work and what I've achieved thus far. To commence with my journey of becoming a Web Developer I'd like to share my work as a pratice to connect with the notion that community is key in this field. 

## Process
I began the process by reviewing new HTML,CSS and Bootstrap content to update my previous page. Such as adding a download file link to my resume. Considering the intention to showcase my work, that was going to be the emphasis.
